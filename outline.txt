Rough sketch of how we want the GUI to look:

- Something along the lines of 'Please enter a 'to do''
- 'Add' button to the right of this ^^^ text field. This will add the 'to do' to the list
- List will have the 'to do' in a box like this vvvv
---------------------------------
| Finish data structures project |
----------------------------------
THESE THINGS vvvvv WILL ONLY POP UP IF YOU HOVER OVER THE BOX/TASK 

- To the right of this box will be a little 'pencil' icon. This will be the button you can click to edit
- To the left is an 'X' icon, this will delete the reminder
- To the left of the 'X' icon will be a check icon. This will mark the reminder as completed

UX Features
- Add, remove, complete, and edit tasks
- Text field for user to specify their task.
- The option to delete completed tasks.

GUI Options
- Flask
