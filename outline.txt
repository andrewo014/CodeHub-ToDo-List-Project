Rough sketch of how we want the GUI to look:

- Something along the lines of 'Please enter a 'to do''
- 'Add' button to the right of this ^^^ text field. This will add the 'to do' to the list
- List will have the 'to do' in a box like this vvvv

----------------------------------
- To the right of this box will be a little 'pencil' icon. This will be the button you can click to edit
- To the left is an 'X' icon, this will delete the reminder
- To the left of the 'X' icon will be a check icon. This will mark the reminder as completed

Cool ideas that we MIGHT do
